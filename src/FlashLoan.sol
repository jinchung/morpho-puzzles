/**
 * PUZZLE: Flash Loan from Morpho Blue
 * 
 * SCENARIO:
 * You want to borrow 1,000 USDC from Morpho Blue using a flash loan.
 * A flash loan allows you to borrow assets without collateral, but you must
 * repay the loan plus any fees within the same transaction.
 * 
 * GIVEN:
 * - The Morpho Blue address is provided in the constructor and stored in `morpho`
 * - The `IMorpho` interface is available to interact with Morpho Blue
 * - The `IMorphoFlashLoanCallback` interface defines the callback function
 * - The token address is encoded in the `data` parameter of the callback
 * 
 * OBJECTIVE:
 * Implement the onMorphoFlashLoan() callback function to:
 * 1. Decode the token address from the `data` parameter
 * 2. Receive the borrowed assets from Morpho (they're already in this contract)
 * 3. Use the borrowed assets (in this case, just hold them temporarily)
 * 4. Approve Morpho to take back the borrowed amount
 * 5. Ensure Morpho can reclaim the full loan amount
 * 
 * HINT:
 * - Use `abi.decode(data, (address))` to extract the token address
 * - The borrowed tokens are already in this contract when the callback is called
 * - You only need to approve Morpho to pull them back
 * 
 * SUCCESS CRITERIA:
 * - The flash loan completes without reverting
 * - Morpho's balance is restored to its original amount
 * - This contract has no remaining funds after the flash loan
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * Morpho Blue flash loans are fee-free, so you only need to repay
 * the exact amount borrowed.
